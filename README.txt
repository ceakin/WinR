Description:
I start many programs in windows by pressing Win+R. Some programs
install methods so that you may call them by keying them in from
the Win+R prompt. iTunes does this, for example.

I wanted to open any program by typing something into the RUN
dialog box. For example, if I want to start sublime text or Starcraft 2:
I type 'sublime' and 'sc' respectively into the Win+R prompt.


Usage:
1. If you are using the exe version of WinR.
2. Put the WinR folder in the directory of the
  program you want to create your command for.

  Example:
  "C:\Program Files (x86)\Google\Chrome\Application\chrome.exe"

  -The WinR folder should be inside the same folder as chrome.exe file.
    Which is the Application folder in this case.

3. After this, simply run the program and you're done!
